After the fall of Armageddon and the creation of Aethron from his corpse, the natural balance of the multiverse was restored. The Four Horsemen, born of Armageddon’s sundered soul, fed on the excess of souls in Abaddon, growing in strength until they ascended to the power of demigods. When they emerged from the shadows to reveal themselves to the other gods, their presence sent ripples of unease through the divine realms. Yet, the gods soon realized that these Children of Armageddon posed no immediate threat to the cosmos. Unlike their father, they were disorganized, embroiled in constant conflict with one another. The Lady of Graves, Pharasma, decreed that the Horsemen should remain, taking responsibility for the realm they ruled. Her judgment was swayed by the souls she encountered in the Boneyard - souls so hopeless and nihilistic that no other plane would accept them. In Abaddon, the Horsemen kept these souls in line, or rather the daemons born from them, ensuring that the end they heralded would remain distant. And so, the Riders of the Apocalypse lived on, establishing their Citadels and securing their place within the multiverse. Meanwhile, far across the reaches of the cosmos, the planet Aethron continued to thrive. Aethron flourished, its civilizations rising to unprecedented heights. The inhabitants, known as the Aethrans, became masters of technology, eschewing the arcane arts for the precision and power of their machines. Cities of gleaming metal and glass stretched across the planet, connected by vast networks of energy and information. Their ingenuity knew no bounds; they harnessed the power of their world and reached out to the stars, colonizing the moon that orbited their planet. But beneath the veneer of progress, Aethron was a world divided. The Aethrans were split into mighty nations, each driven by its own ambitions and ideologies. Old rivalries festered, and new tensions arose as the nations vied for supremacy. Peace was always fragile, and war loomed like a storm on the horizon. The spark that ignited the planetary war came in the form of a discovery - a breakthrough that promised unparalleled power to whichever nation could wield it. Buried deep within Aethron’s crust were the Artifacts of the Apocalypse. Disguised in the form of common-day items, they had the power to tear down cities. The nations were unaware of the true origin of these relics, calling them simply the Artifacts, thrown themselves into chaos as they raced to seize them for their own goals. What began as a shadowy arms race quickly escalated into a full-scale war, with each nation unleashing its deadliest technologies in a desperate bid for dominance. The once-thriving civilization of Aethron began to tear itself apart, as the pursuit of power drove the planet’s inhabitants to madness and ruin. The war raged for decades, leaving Aethron a desolate shadow of its former glory. Even the moon did not escape the devastation. The Aethspyr - a weapon of unimaginable power, crafted by the finest engineers was unleashed. Its destructive force pierced the moon’s core, causing it to crack and splinter. Fragments of the shattered satellite rained down upon Aethron, unleashing a cataclysmic event that extinguished countless lives. The colonies on the moon, once bustling with life, were obliterated, leaving no survivors. Yet, despite the devastation, the gods did not intervene. They turned a blind eye to the planet’s suffering, their gaze only shifting when a Lone Aethran discovered the true nature of Aethron and, more importantly, how to wield it. They discovered that not only was Aethron actually the corpse of a god, but also which god it once was. The Artifacts of the Apocalypse were the manifestations of Armageddon’s power, seeping out of his body even in death, for such power cannot be extinguished as long as existence itself persists. These manifestations were but a mere drop of this power, fumes if you will, of something much greater. The Lone Aethran uncovered that enough of these fumes could fuel Armageddon’s corpse to a point where it could be controlled like a puppet, unleashing its raw power to conquer other worlds. They gathered a group of individuals from across the planet, all connected to the Dead God’s power, and set out to collect as many of the Artifacts of the Apocalypse as they could, seeking those with the greatest potential. But this endeavor was soon ended by the gods. The gods debated how to stop the Lone Aethran before they reached their goal - how to punish them for their audacity. Their discussions grew dark as they concluded that placing life on the corpse of Armageddon had been a mistake, a mistake that should be erased, as was the god of apocalypse himself. Yet, simply destroying Aethron was impossible; the body would return time and again. So, the gods sought to rid the planet of the conditions necessary for inteligent life. Thus, they sent Sarenrae to chain Aethron to its star with an unbreakable curse, so that one side would never escape its flames. Sarenrae renamed the star Vigilis, and it became her watchman over the resting place of Armageddon. This event now, is simply known as "The Binding". As the Everlight was doing the deed, the Lone Aethran felt the presence of the gods and their machinations. They ceased all efforts as the thoughts of impending doom field their mind but they quickly resolved that their research could not be left unfulfilled; if they could not achieve it, perhaps something in the future could. They documented everything they knew - about the nature of Aethron, about the Artifacts of the Apocalypse, and about their civilization's technologies. They hoped that enough of their civilizations remains, so that the knowledge could be of use to whoever might find it in the future. Then, after all was done, they slipped into the shadows, and no one knows what became of them. For the Aethrans, it was the day that time stopped, and the forces of nature consumed them in their wrath, as they so often do. Some sought salvation, but the planet’s transformation proved overwhelming, and they too perished. Not much remains of the Aethrans now, but one can stumble upon the traces of their exitance. The shattered moon proves with its every cycle that they were here. Yet, despite the gods' intentions, the planet, bound to Vigilis, will inevitably begin a new cycle of life. From the ashes of the past, something new will rise - something unforeseen, even by the gods themselves. The cycle of existence persists, unyielding, and in the heart of the twilight zone, life will find a way to endure.
