In the aftermath of "The Binding," shattered the Aethran civilization, the planet lay devastated, transformed from a flourishing world into a chaotic wasteland. The forces unleashed had warped the climate, and relentless natural disasters scoured the planet, erasing nearly all remnants of its former glory. Few Artifacts survived the destruction, relics of Aethran ingenuity now buried in forgotten ruins. Some others manifested sporadically during the transitional period that followed, scattered fragments of an age lost to time. Yet, despite the gods’ wish for Aethron to be a desolate monument to hubris, life endured. Over a span of one and a half million years, Aethron bore witness to a new evolution, an emergence of intelligent life - "the first born" evolved not of divine intervention but of raw persistence. In this unforgiving world, survival required brutal adaptation. No divine hand nurtured this rebirth; nature alone shaped the tenacious, resilient creatures who would inherit the planet. As the planet settled into its altered form, three vast continents emerged, nestled within Aethron’s twilight zone. One of these continents, Mirtar, that would be the focus of all coming chapter. Mindful of past mistakes, the gods took a new path, watching over Aethron’s reborn civilizations more closely than they had the previous inhabitants. They guided “the First Born” - beings that arose naturally from Aethron’s soil, stone, and shadow. This time, the gods did not linger in the shadows; they spoke plainly and abundantly to the First Born, making their presence known as guardians rather than distant creators. Their primary intention was to shield these nascent races, ensuring Armageddon’s tainted magic did not scar this new beginning. Under divine oversight, the fledgling societies learned to thrive, unwittingly protected from the lingering echoes of the god of apocalypse. It was a cautious balance the gods struck, carefully shepherding life without overstepping, ever wary of awakening another era of ruin. Their decision marked the beginning of Aethron’s great era, an Epoch of Great Myths—a time of legendary heroes and monstrous foes, when gods walked alongside mortals and shared in their triumphs and fears.
