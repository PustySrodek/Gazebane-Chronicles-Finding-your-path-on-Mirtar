From the Endless Void beyond time and space, emerged the Primordial Inevitables. These entities were not of flesh or spirit, but of raw, unbridled concepts, embodying the fundamental aspects of reality itself. As they came into being, so too did the notion of creation, a force that yearned to bring form to the formless and order to the chaotic abyss. Thus, the Primordials began their great experiment, shaping the raw fabric of the cosmos into what would become known as the First World. But creation is never without consequence. From the very act of shaping existence, another force was born; a shadow cast by the light of creation. This shadow took form as Armageddon, the Primordial God of Apocalypse. He was not born of malice or rage, but rather as the embodiment of an inevitable truth: all things that are made must one day be unmade. Armageddon was the harbinger of the end, the first and true horseman of the apocalypse, the force that would one day bring an end to all things, not out of hatred but out of necessity. Unlike Rovagug, the Rough Beast, Armageddon accepted the need for creation. He understood that for something to end, it must first begin. However, he too desired to wield the power granted by his existence. As the Primordials shaped the First World, Armageddon chose a corner of it to conduct his own experiments - experiments not in creation, but in destruction. He sought to unravel what had been woven, to test the limits of decay and the boundaries of death. The other gods, wary of his presence, watched as Armageddon went about his work. But they soon realized that he was an integral part of balance, a force that could not be ignored nor destroyed. As long as there was creation, there would be Armageddon, for as long as a single particle existed, so too would the potential for its destruction. And so, unlike Rovagug, who was cast into the Outer Rifts, Armageddon was permitted to dwell among the other gods. Time flowed like a river through the cosmos, and the gods grew tiered of the First World. They turned their gaze outward and began to craft something far grander: the Multiverse. With every new world, every new plane of existence, Armageddon's power grew. Creation was a spark, and he was the flame that would one day consume it. In the shadow of this new reality, Armageddon tore the piece of the First World he experimented on away, carving out a realm of his own. Abaddon, a place where only death and decay reigned. But the multiverse was not without its disruptions. Rovagug, the Rough Beast, slipped into the universe, bringing with him a wave of unbridled destruction. Worlds crumbled beneath his wrath, and entire planes were torn asunder. This incursion enraged Armageddon. Rovagug, in his mindless fury, had taken from him the opportunity to bring about a proper end to these worlds - an end that was calculated, inevitable, and fitting. Yet, in this fury, Armageddon saw an opportunity. If Rovagug could be guided, could be pointed toward the right targets, then perhaps those worlds that truly mattered—worlds like Earth and Golarion, could meet their proper doom. And so, in the shadows, Armageddon approached Rovagug, whispering promises of destruction and guiding the beast toward those worlds that the gods so desperately sought to protect. The two forces of apocalypse became an unholy alliance, and their actions sparked what would come to be known as the War in Heaven. The gods rallied against Rovagug, and when they finally cast him down into the heart of Golarion, they turned their wrathful gaze upon Armageddon, knowing he had been the true architect of this cataclysm. In a final act of defiance, Armageddon prepared for his end. As the gods' forces prepared to storm Abaddon, he enacted a powerful ritual, one that would ensure his legacy would endure even in death. He split his soul into four fragments, each embodying one of the apocalyptic aspects he represented: Death, Decay, Deprivation and Destruction, leaving him as hollow husk, that relied solely on his power, one could say he was powered by the apocalypse itself. From these fragments were born the Four Horsemen, the first of the Endbringers, each carrying a piece of their father’s power. As the Horsemen took shape, Armageddon commanded them to flee, to hide in the depths of Abaddon and bide their time. They would be the keepers of his legacy, the harbingers of the apocalypse that would one day come. Armageddon railed the first of deamons of Abaddon and then, the gods descended upon him and event known simply as the The Last Battle has started. It was fierce, a clash of divine might and apocalyptic power. The gods fought with all their strength, determined to end the threat of Armageddon once and for all. Among them was Sarenrae, the Dawnflower, whose light had the power to purify even the darkest of shadows. It was her who struck the final blow, her blade of searing light cutting through the darkness of Armageddon’s form. But the battle was not without cost. Countless celestial beings fell with the God of Apocalyspe and his deamons, Their simple act of death has fueled the realm of Abaddon to protect it against the wrath of the Victors and keep existing, despite its creators death. As the gods couldn't simply destroy his realm, they gathered his remains in order to simply spite their now dead brother. They carried his broken form from Abaddon and cast his corpse into the Universe and shaped it into a new planet - a world they called Aethron. Upon this world, they planted the seeds of life, ensuring that it would thrive as a symbol of their victory. Where once Armageddon sought to bring an end, now life flourished, a testament to the gods’ triumph over the forces of apocalypse. But the spirit of Armageddon lives on in the depths of Abaddon, in the form of the Four Horsemen who wait for the day when the final apocalypse will come - the day when all creation will meet its inevitable end.
