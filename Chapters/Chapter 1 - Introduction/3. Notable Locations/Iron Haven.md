*The vesperan side of Mirtar is split by a long mountain-chain called the Broken Peaks. These mountains are the origin of many rivers, one of them is Geratha. The River runs to the aurora, right to the Orydian Gulf and as of the Epoch of Ignorance is the most influential on the continent. Her banks house the modern day power house of mining which is Eisenberg and further down, Iron Haven that day and night processes whatever is sent to them through this river.*
## Overview
 Iron Haven - once simply called the City of Iron, lies amidst the choking fumes and ever-turning gears. This industrial colossus stands as a testament to unrelenting march towards progress, though its beauty, if it ever had any, is long buried beneath the soot and smoke that cover the sky. A colony of Eisenberg, Iron Haven was forged during the Epoch of Ignorance and from the day its foundations were laid, its forges and factories have never ceased their tireless labour, forever bound to the demands of their faraway parent. Iron Haven is more than a city, but a machine. Here, raw material is not merely refined; it is transformed into the cutting edge of invention. The city has become a sanctuary for the brilliant and the mad alike - visionaries who see in the city’s unceasing flow of ore and fuel a chance to birth their wildest dreams. Among their works are marvels that now shape the world: airships that glide through the heavens, the Falstein Cells that gives citizens much needed comforts, and automatons that blur the line between man and machine. Eisenberg's military presence is strong in Iron Haven, its soldiers armed with the latest guns and armour, some even having access to mighty power armours. Its enforcers supported by the cold efficiency of automatons. The walls of the city, equipped with the lastest of cannons and magical barriers, protect the citizens from the outside danger. The city itself has become plagued, with an aristocracy of old-money families, which ancestors were the most famous of inventors. These elites no longer contribute, but merely bask in their comforts, lording over the masses of laborers who keep the gears of Iron Haven turning. Since the time of the Nightmare war, which also brought the Ventrii's undead raids onto Eisenberg and Iron Haven, all instances of necromancers and the undead are banned from the city and those who are caught are locked away in the Crematorium, a high security prison that deals specifically with those kinds of threats. The city is ruled with an iron fist by a governor, selected from Eisenberg's ranks, and beholden to the laws of the parent state, often referred to as the Iron Hand. Beneath this rule, there is little room for freedom or dissent. Here, all is ordered, all is regulated, and all must serve the machine.
## History
Iron Haven’s origins trace back to the Epoch of Ignorance. The city was founded by the Rainer brothers, two visionary gnomes from Eisenberg who saw potential in expanding their parent city's grasp on production. Driven by the endless flow of resources along the Geratha River, the brothers presented their grand vision to Eisenberg’s ruling council. With their plan approved, they gathered a small band of volunteers, their families, and a contingent of seasoned mercenaries, setting forth to claim a patch of wilderness where their dream could become reality. The journey was perilous. For two long weeks, they navigated untamed lands, losing lives along the way to the harsh conditions and beasts that prowled the region. When they finally reached the perfect site, a fertile yet monster-infested area, a brutal battle ensued. The mercenaries fought fiercely, driving out the creatures that had long claimed the land as their own. With victory came the beginning of Iron Haven, though the price paid in blood was a heavy one. The Rainer brothers conducted a ritual, sending a beacon to Eisenberg to signal their success. Supplies and reinforcements soon flowed from the parent city, and the construction of Iron Haven began in earnest. In those early days, the fledgling colony barely survived, its defences hastily erected to fend off the relentless attacks of monsters. But the people of Iron Haven, driven by necessity and the promise of progress, persevered. Over the years, Iron Haven grew, its factories multiplying and its walls strengthening. The city’s true rise to power came during the Nightmare War. Iron Haven’s advanced weaponry - its airships, magical cannons, and firearms, turned the tide of war. In the aftermath, the city emerged as a dominant force, its technology coveted by nations far and wide.
