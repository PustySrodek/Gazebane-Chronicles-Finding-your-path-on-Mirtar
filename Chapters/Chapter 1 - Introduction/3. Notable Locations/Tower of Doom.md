*The Vesperan coast of Mirtar, compared to other parts of the continent, is completely in ruins. The broken empire of [[Ferrgrad]] is the closest thing to a functioning civilization in this area. Aside from the monsters and dangers that inhabit Mirtar, its noxian region also houses the most remnants of [[8. The Nightmare War]]. The likes of Scout hounds and Steam Knights, abandoned by their Deamonic masters, roam this area in great numbers, doing what they were created to do: kill anything that dares to exist in their line of sight. However, with either luck or knowledge, one can find a safe haven here. In a twist of godly irony, the Tower of Doom now protects those it was originally built to exterminate, rusting away under the Mirtarian skies.*
## Overview
The Tower of Doom is a relic from the past, built upon an even older one. It was created by the smartest of Daemons from Abaddon to further Szuriel's plot to conquer and possess the dead body of Armageddon. This structure, a fusion of daemonic magic and machinery, served as the Nexus Point between Abaddon and Gazebane. Over time, this engineering marvel became home to some Mirtarians, who established a growing city-state within its walls. It continues to grow in power and population year after year. Anyone is free to come and become a citizen if they are brave or foolish enough to cross the perilous lands leading to the Tower of Doom. Though the portal in the bowels of the Tower remains closed, the machinery still functions, providing its inhabitants with a semblance of comfort. The pipes continue to pump strange fluids through the floors, gears keep rotating, and elevators still operate, even centuries after [[8. The Nightmare War]]. These systems generate much-needed electricity, hot water (if it can be called water), and at least a working sewage system. The whole strucete protects its inhabitatns from the outside world by itself, emanating an aura that for some reason repels monsters as if they feared it's very presence. The Tower of Doom has been thoroughly searched and explored, but the underground levels are too dangerous for the citizens to venture into. No one who has gone beyond the gates to the underground has ever returned, and some claim to hear their voices echoing through the Tower's machinery. Legends say that Tower is alive, feeding on the souls that die in it's bowels and waits for further orders from the daemoic lords to start the conquest anew.
## History
Before the Nightmare War, where the Tower of Doom now stands, there once thrived the Republic of Ynosi. This city, which had stood since the Epoch of Great Myths, was one of the major powers on the Vesperan coast of Mirtar, rivaled only by its fierce neighbor, Ferrgrad. The Ynosi people were a proud and influential culture, deeply rooted in the myths and legends of their time. However, everything changed after "The Shattering of Faith." In the wake of this disaster, the republic, instead of hiding behind the city gates, launched a desperate campaign to reclaim their homeland. They believed they could drive out the monsters by expanding, and thus began building villages and settlements all over the coast, despite the dangers lurking there. This strategy brought the Ynosi into direct conflict with Ferrgrad, whose emperors saw the rapid expansion as a threat to their own power. As tensions rose, Ferrgrad became increasingly aggressive, leading to numerous bloody skirmishes and battles between the two civilizations. This conflict continued until the Epoch of Ignorance, when Ferrgradian Emperor Radoslav III declared that Ferrgrad would conquer the entirety of Ynosi. Ferrgradian troops began their invasion, quickly claiming the settlements of the republic and burning most of them down. This culminated in the Siege of Ynosi, which ultimately led to the creation of the Tower of Doom and the beginning of the Nightmare War.
