*Somewhere in The Universe, in the far reaches of cosmos, a lone planet with shattered moon, orbits its star. Gazebane, its inhabitants call it; a realm caught in the eternal grip of an ancient curse. This world, forsaken by the gods and untouched by time, it is a place of perpetual torment - a celestial prison bound by a cruel fate.*

*This world is shackled to its own star, chained by an invisible force that holds it fast, refusing to let it turn. On one side, the star: Vigilis hangs in the sky, an ever-watchful eye that never blinks. It bathes the land in a relentless, scorching light, burning the earth, leaving not even a trace of water. The ground, cracked and lifeless, stretches out in a barren wasteland, where even the most resilient of creatures die and turn into ash, becoming one with the desert. Only few find home here, somewhere in the Badlands, were the Gazebanes watchman doesn't have that much influence.*

*The other side of the planet is cast into darkness, a place where the light has long since fled. Vigilis’s cruel gaze never reaches these lands, leaving the land to wither in the icy embrace of unending night. The earth is 11frozen, locked in a state of eternal winter, where the only light comes from the distant, uncaring stars. The cold is a living thing, seeping into the bones of any who dare to tread these desolate lands. Shadows stretch endlessly across the landscape, and in their depths, dark things stir - creatures that have never known the warmth of the sun, and whose hearts beat with the cold rhythm of the void.*

*Between these two realms lies a narrow band, Gazebanes terminator, where the light and dark meet in a twisted parody of balance. Here, Vigilis forever lingers on the horizon, casting a pale, sickly glow over the land. The sky is a murky and colourless expanse, where Aethspyr, the shattered moon roams round and round. This twilight zone is the only place where life manged to thrive and civilizations rose up to conquer this world. However the brutal nature of Gazebane does not make it easy for them, thus they are stuck fighting not only themselves but also the planet for survival.*

*This is the fate of the world and is people, a realm of extremes, where the star never sets, and the night never ends - a world forsaken by time and gods, locked in the grip of a curse that will never be broken.*

## Welcome to Gazebane, the World Abandoned
We would like to introduces a dark fantasy setting designed to challenge and immerse players and GMs alike. It is inspired by metal music (Bands like Battle Beast, Rhapsody of fire or even something more darker like Candlemass) and works of various grim dark, dark fantasy works. The fantasy of this world also aims for a early industrial era (Earth time around 1750 - 1800) that incorporates magic into itself, with knowledge of science is as important as knowledge of the magic.

This setting encourages a different approach for both players and GMs. Players will need to embrace a world where everyday is a struggle and victories hard-earned. Character choices will often involve difficult trade-offs, and survival will depend on resourcefulness, adaptability, and cooperation. For GMs, Gazebane provides a rich tapestry for crafting stories that emphasize tension, atmosphere, and the consequences of actions. Establishing expectations and boundaries through a _Session Zero_ is highly recommended, ensuring that everyone at the table is comfortable with the setting’s darker themes and aligned on the tone of the campaign.

While it has been written with Pathfinder Second Edition in mind, the world of Gazebane can be adapted to other RPG systems with ease.

We have three main goals with this book. First, it introduces the core elements of Gazebane, including its history, themes, locationsand unique features. Second, it explores the land of Mirtar, the most populated region in this twilight world, detailing its geography, factions, and key locations. Third, it adapts _Pathfinder Second Edition_ mechanics to fit the setting, offering variant rules, thematic adjustments, and new ways to approach existing material, like modifying regional backgrounds to better reflect the tone of Gazebane without altering their mechanics. Whether you’re here for a short adventure or an extended campaign, this guide will help you make the most of Gazebane’s dark world.
## Understanding Gazebane - an Eye Planet
To understand the locations and events within this book, you must first understand the unique nature of Gazebane, a tidally locked planet. This means that Gazebane’s rotation is perfectly synchronized with its orbit speed around Vigilis, causing one side to always face the light, while the other is forever shrouded in darkness. If you need a comparison, think of how Earth’s moon always shows the same face to our planet. This relationship creates a world vastly different from what we are accustomed to, with one hemisphere bathed in perpetual day and the other in endless night.

Life here, however, thrives mostly in the narrow twilight zone - the band between the scorching day and the freezing night. In this zone, there is no day-and-night cycle as we know it. The sky remains in a constant state of dawn or dusk. The line that goes is the middle of the twilight zone is known as The Terminator. The position of Vigilis is fixed relative to the ground, hanging low on the horizon, neither fully rising nor setting. This twilight band is the only place where temperatures and conditions allow life to flourish, creating a fragile and unique environment that defines the entire planet. Great example are the plants that grow slightly in an angle, making their top face Vigilis. 

Gazebane has a moon, Aethspyr, that got destroyed in the Ancient Times and now is a floating belt of rocks, that manged to stay in orbit despite the odds. Being fairly big and well visible, people of Gazebane use it to measure time, similarly to how we do it using the sun. Aethspyr orbit is almost in parallel with the planets terminator making the star and the moon, two very distinct bodies on the sky.

The planet has four distinct poles, both magnetic and thermal. The thermal poles correspond to the two extremes of constant day and nigh. These poles and hemispheres are called Lux and Nox. Lux is the side of eternal day, Nox of eternal night and their poles lay directly in the middle of those hemispheres. The magnetic poles lay on the planets terminator and cannot be easy distinguished other than they reside on different continents, as such the people of Gazebane agreed that these poles and hemispheres should be called: Vespera which represent Dusk of Aethspyr and Aurora which represent Dawn of Aethspyr. Compasses on this world also use these names though the constant shining Vigilis makes it hard to forget the sides of the world. Just to clarify, if Vigilis is shining on your right shoulder, you're facing the vesperan side and if it shines on the left, it's auroran.

***Side note for science nerds: We do realise that things on a tidally locked planet would vary and be much more complicated to what this book will show and what do we want to achieve with this world. We are pulling our "It's just magic" card and we would appreciate if you'd just roll with it***
## A Harsh life on Gazebane
Gazebane is a harsh and unforgiving place. Survival often comes at great cost, and the decisions characters make can have far-reaching consequences. The setting’s themes focus on survival against overwhelming odds, the fragility and importance of hope in a hostile world, and the corrupting nature of power - whether magical, political, or personal. Life and death are deeply intertwined here, and even the past lingers in the form of cursed ruins, restless undead, and scars left by long-forgotten conflicts.

Through out it's history Gazebane went through a number of events that caused the surface to be plagued by more and more monsters. By the Epoch of Innovation, which is the current epoch, the surface of the planet is filled with them. From seas to forests and mountains, nowhere is safe and people caught by those abominatons can only hope that they die quickly. 

Life isn't cheap here, life is a resource. The planet houses around 100 milion creatures (that can be categorised as civilised) around 80% of it resides in huge cities, fortresses made to shield their people from outside dangers. These cities are very few and far in-between and their cultures varies a lot, but they are connected by the willingness to survive and endure. As of the Epoch of Innovation, people of Gazebane found various ways to travel between those cities. Whether it's airships, teleportation or long journeys on known relatively safe land and water trade routes, the ways of travel are there. Some are better but none are a 100% guarantee to arrive whole and well. Even Teleportation.
